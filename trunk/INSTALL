These are generic installation instructions.

YAGF requires Qt 4.6 or later and Aspell libraries.
Note about Qt 5: YAGF cannot be built with Qt 5 yet.
If your system uses Qt 5 by default you should install Qt 4 as well.
You should then find where qmake for Qt 4 is and uncomment the following line in CMakeLists.txt:
set(QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE /usr/bin/qmake-qt4)
If qmake for QT 4 is called differently in you system you should edit the path portion of this line.

You will need CMake to build YAGF from sources.
There are two modes for building YAGF with CMake: in-source and out-source.
The out-source mode is preferred. To build YAGF in this mode follow these instructions:
make a directory for your build (for example yagf-build). Assuming your yagf-build directory is in the same directory as the yagf directory you can command:

cd yagf-build
cmake ../yagf
make
sudo make install

You can now remove the yagf-build directory.

In order to perform an in-source build you should issue this simple set of commands:

cd yagf
cmake ./
make
sudo make install

There are several important variables defined in CMakeLists.txt file.
The QML_INSTALL_PREFIX and QML_DESTINATION valiarbles define where qml (traslation) files are going to be installed. The full path is cistructed as QML_INSTALL_PREFIX+QML_DESTINATION and it is the place where the program will look for the compiled translation files.
While YAGF may be built to support multi-image TIFFs, I have found that it conflicts with JPEG input libraries. This may be reso;ved in the future.
If you want to build the program with multi-image TIFF support, open CMakeLists.txt file and change the line
set(MPTIFF_SUPPORT false)
to
set(MPTIFF_SUPPORT true)
and then build the program as described above.
